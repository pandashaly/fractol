Map Checklist
============
Parse the map
	Open map and count lines
	Create 2d array
Some checks:
	Does the map file exist ?
	Is the map rectangular ? (All the lines should be the same length.)
	Is there something in the map file ?
	Is the map enclosed in walls ? '1'
		(Check the first and last lines and columns, they should all be 1)
	Is there only one exit ? 'E'
		(count how many 'E' you find on the map)
	Is there only one start position ?
		(count how many 'P' you find on the map)
	Is there at least one collectible?
		(count how many 'C' you find on the map)
	Calculate window size depending on map, and sprite size.
	Are all the collectibles and the Exit accessible from the start position?
	if not all collectibles are accessible, the map is invalid

Game checklist
==============
Create a window using MiniLibX
Create the required struct to store all the necessary information
Make sure all your sprites are 32x32
Load all the sprites (images) for your game and store them into memory
Create the different hooks
key_handler
mouse_handler (if necessary)
close_handler, this is a hook on the red cross that closes the program correctly
loop_hook (=> you game loop)

Render checklist
================
Draw the background
Draw the not movable parts of the map
Draw the player
